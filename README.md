# nenemark2 - NES/Famicom compatible 6502 computer

Description is a bit of a to-do, but the juicy bits are in the firmware folder.  
Also, schematics are in "nenescm.pdf"

## NES/Famicom compatible ?

What it means:  
- ram, rom and peripherals are mapped to the NES/Famicom cartridge address space (work ram excluded)
- programmes don't use decimal mode
- nmi line isn't used

## Legal annoyances (licensing, that is GPL2-only)
